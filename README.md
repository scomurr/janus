# Janus - Automated Micro-Cap Equity Research Platform

Janus is a comprehensive financial analysis platform designed for systematic micro-cap equity research and portfolio management. The system combines automated data collection, AI-powered stock analysis, and real-time portfolio tracking to identify and manage micro-cap investment opportunities.

## Use Case

Janus is designed for systematic micro-cap equity research where traditional analysis tools are insufficient due to limited coverage and data availability. The platform automates the entire research pipeline from initial discovery through final investment decisions, making it possible to efficiently analyze thousands of micro-cap opportunities that would be impractical to research manually.

## Ticker Selection Criteria

The system applies rigorous filtering criteria to identify investable micro-cap opportunities:

### Market Cap & Size Requirements
- **Small-cap stocks only**: Market cap under $300 million
- **Revenue efficiency**: Revenue must be at least 1% of market cap (excludes shell companies)

### Financial Health Requirements  
- **Profitable companies**: Must have positive revenue and gross margins
- **Reasonable valuation**: P/E ratio between 1-100 (excludes loss-making and extremely overvalued stocks)
- **Dividend sanity check**: Dividend yield under 50% (excludes dividend traps)

### Liquidity & Trading Requirements
- **Liquid stocks**: Daily volume above 10,000 shares  
- **Trading liquidity**: Daily volume must exceed market cap รท 1000 (ensures adequate liquidity)
- **Price stability**: 52-week high/low ratio under 100x (excludes extreme penny stocks)

## Technical Indicators & Analysis Framework

### Core Financial Metrics
- Market capitalization, revenue, and gross margins
- Trailing P/E ratio and dividend yield analysis
- 52-week price range and volatility assessment
- Daily trading volume and liquidity analysis

### AI-Powered Analysis Criteria
The system evaluates stocks across multiple dimensions using a structured analytical framework:

- **Liquidity & Tradability**: Average daily dollar volume, float percentage, bid-ask spread
- **Dilution Risk Assessment**: Recent offerings, ATM usage, warrants, convertibles, S-3 shelf registrations
- **Solvency Analysis**: Cash vs. burn rate, debt maturity schedules, going-concern risk
- **Governance & Compliance**: Insider control, related-party transactions, listing status, audit flags
- **Catalyst Identification**: Upcoming events within 6 months (earnings, contracts, regulatory approvals)

### Multi-Model AI Scoring
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Advanced reasoning and financial analysis
- **Google Gemini**: Parallel analysis for consensus building
- **Local LLM (Ollama)**: Independent validation and cost-effective processing

## System Overview

The Janus platform consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide end-to-end micro-cap equity research capabilities:

- **Automated Data Discovery**: Weekly collection of all NYSE and NASDAQ stock tickers
- **Market Data Enrichment**: Real-time financial data retrieval via Yahoo Finance API
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Multi-model stock scoring using OpenAI, Google Gemini, and local LLM models
- **Portfolio Management**: Real-time portfolio tracking with performance visualization
- **Research Console**: Web-based interface for analyzing stocks with multiple buy recommendations

## Architecture Components

### n8n Workflows (`n8n-workflows/`)
Automated workflows that handle the core data processing pipeline:
- **Ticker Discovery**: Weekly retrieval of all stock tickers from exchanges
- **Data Enrichment**: Bulk collection of financial metrics for all tickers
- **AI Scoring**: Multi-model analysis generating buy/sell recommendations
- **Execution Support**: Portfolio rebalancing and trade execution workflows

### Python Yahoo Finance API (`python-yfinance/`)
Flask-based microservice providing standardized access to market data:
- Market capitalization data for multiple tickers
- Comprehensive financial information retrieval
- Real-time and historical price data
- Dockerized service integrated with the n8n network

### Node.js Research Console (`node-ui/`)
Web-based financial research interface:
- **Research Console**: Identifies stocks with multiple AI buy recommendations
- **Portfolio Dashboard**: Real-time portfolio performance visualization with interactive charting
- **Analysis Tools**: Generates structured prompts for detailed financial analysis

### Portfolio Analysis (`n8n-porfolio/`)
Contains analysis workflows and documentation for portfolio management operations.

## Database Requirements

**Critical Dependency**: All components require access to a PostgreSQL database instance that must be available to both n8n and the individual applications.

The system expects the following PostgreSQL tables:
- `ticker_universe`: Complete ticker data with financial metrics
- `ticker_scores`: AI-generated buy/sell recommendations 
- `daily_valuation`: Portfolio performance tracking data

## Key Features

- **Systematic Stock Discovery**: Automated identification of all tradeable micro-cap securities
- **Multi-Model AI Analysis**: Consensus scoring from multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, local LLM)
- **Liquidity & Risk Filtering**: Automated screening for trading volume, solvency, and governance risks
- **Real-Time Portfolio Tracking**: Visual performance monitoring with asset-level breakdowns
- **Research Workflow Integration**: Seamless data flow from discovery to analysis to execution

## Getting Started

1. Ensure PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
2. Deploy the Python Yahoo Finance API service
3. Configure n8n workflows for data collection and analysis
4. Launch the Node.js Research Console for portfolio monitoring

Each component directory contains detailed setup and configuration documentation in its respective `.md` file.
