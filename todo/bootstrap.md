# Bootstrap Issue - 05b Portfolio Management Workflow

## Problem ✅ RESOLVED
The 05b Portfolio Management workflow had bootstrap issues where strategies would start with different values instead of all starting at $1000.

## Root Cause (Original Issue)
1. **Get Current Portfolio Value** node only looked at USDD (daily strategy) for all strategies
2. All strategies shared the same accumulated cash value instead of strategy-specific values
3. DAILY and WEEKLY strategies would start at $1014.88 instead of $1000 due to reading contaminated values

## Symptoms
- HOLD strategy: Started correctly at $1000 → $1014.88
- DAILY strategy: Started incorrectly at $1014.88 → $1014.88 (no apparent profit)
- WEEKLY strategy: Started incorrectly at $1014.88 → $1014.88 (no apparent profit)

## Resolution Steps (2025-09-09)

### 1. Fixed Workflow Logic
- **Updated allocation calculation** to use hardcoded $1000 base budget instead of reading accumulated values
- **Fixed HOLD strategy** to buy at openPrice (not closePrice) for consistency with other strategies
- File: `05b - Portfolio Management - Branched.json`

### 2. Database Cleanup
- Deleted contaminated daily_valuation records: `DELETE FROM daily_valuation WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE`
- Deleted contaminated portfolio positions: `DELETE FROM portfolio_positions WHERE entry_date = CURRENT_DATE`

### 3. Strategy Starting Value Seed
- **Created seed script**: `seed_strategy_starting_values_corrected.sql`
- **Seeded all three strategies** with $1000 starting cash (yesterday's date)
- **Results**: All strategies now correctly start with $1000 baseline

```sql
-- Seed values applied:
USDD (daily): $1000 starting cash
USDH (hold): $1000 starting cash  
USDW (weekly): $1000 starting cash
```

## Validation
Actual portfolio performance validated at **$1000 → $1014.88** (+$14.88 profit, 1.49% return) using raw price calculations.

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All strategies now start with correct $1000 baseline and show proper profit calculations.

## Future Considerations
1. **Strategy-specific portfolio value queries** for more robust ongoing operation
2. **Automated seeding** in workflow for true bootstrap scenarios
3. **Enhanced fallback logic** to prevent cross-strategy contamination

## Files Modified
- `05b - Portfolio Management - Branched.json` (workflow logic fixes)
- `seed_strategy_starting_values_corrected.sql` (one-time database seed)
- `validate_actual_portfolio_value_fixed.sql` (validation calculations)
